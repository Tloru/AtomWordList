# AtomWordList
This is a small python project I wrote when I was just starting out with python. 
It takes a word and then tries to find what element symbols on the periodic table will write out that word. 
For example, 

```
bacon
```

Might become:

```
BaCoN
Barium
Cobalt
Nitrogen
```

## Installation
it's pretty easy to install, just

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Tloru/AtomWordList.git
```

## Usage
To use, just

```
$ cd AtomWordList
$ python elememts.py
```

You'll them be prompted (invisibly) to enter a few words. 
hit enter to see the results.
